# The-Quest-for-Crystal-Kingdom
The Quest for crystal kingdom game which uses the concept of Trees, Graphs and Algorithms.This game inlcudes:
1. finding the shortest path between any two areas in the forest.
2. The shortest path from current location.
3. The minimum spanning tree of the forest by both algorithms.
4. The score increased/decreased at every step, and the final score at the end.
5. The menu must have these features but is not limited to
6. Shortest path using default location (0,0) by Floyd/ Dijkstra.
7. Shortest path using custom location (coordinates entered by the user) by Floyd/ Dijkstra.
8. Minimum Spanning Tree by Prims and Kruskal.
